 * LIVE MAP: the world as dots, lighting up where people are
 *
 *   land      every continent drawn as an even field of dots (one
 *             path, so it's light), cropped where nobody lives
 *   ping      something happens somewhere (a signup, an order):
 *             the dots around it light up, a hairline ring ripples
 *             out, and the light fades slowly, so the last minute's
 *             activity stays on the map as a faint tint
 *   label     one card follows the newest ping, gliding from city
 *             to city with its words morphing, never a pile of
 *             popups; near an edge it swings to the other side
 *   route     a ping with a "from" draws an arc from there to here,
 *             and a short dash runs along it, like a parcel
 *   home      fixed places (an office, a store) sit as rings
 *
 * The coastlines are hand-drawn outlines in longitude and latitude,
 * coarse on purpose: at this dot size you'd never see the detail.
